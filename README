Convert::BulkDecoder version 1.00
=================================

Convert::BulkDecoder provides an easy way to decode binaries from 
email and news articles. It supports uuencoded contents, yencoded
contents and MIME attachments.

For example, to decode a multi-part yencoded article from the
command line:

  perl -MConvert::BulkDecoder \
   -e 'Convert::BulkDecoder->new->decode([<>])' \
     part01.yenc part02.yenc ...

From a program:

  my $cvt = new Convert::BulkDecoder::;
  # Collect the articles into an array ref.
  my $art = [<>];
  # Decode.
  my $res =  $cvt->decode($art);
  die("Failed!") unless $res eq "OK";
  print "Extracted ", $cvt->{size}, " bytes",
        " to file ", $cvt->{file}, "\n";

Note that it doesn't matter if the articles contain uuencoded,
yencoded or MIME encoded data.

An example program 'mfetch' is included to fetch and extract
the contents from news articles:

  mfetch alt.binaries.linux 31544 31542 31541 31543 31545
